# Deep Learning Trainingscenter

This repository serves as a collection for exercises on which I have been working on during the 4 ECTS module `deep learning` at the bachelor degree course in [Data Science at FHNW](https://www.fhnw.ch/en/degree-programmes/engineering/bsc-data-science). Part of the assessment for this course was the submission of two small projects which are listed below.

## Structure
- Task 1: Image classification using MLP's and CNN's. See: [mc1_main_notebook.ipynb](mini-challenges/mc1_image_classification/mc1_main_notebook.ipynb)
- Task 2: Image captioning using CNN's and LSTM's. See: [mc2_main_notebook.ipynb](mini-challenges/mc2_image_captioning/mc2_main_notebook.ipynb)

## Image classification using MLP's and CNN's
The aim of this work was to train and evaluate several neural network constellations for their performance on an image classification task. The image classification is done on the [CIFAR10](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html) dataset. The comparison focuses on MLP's and CNN's using different network sizes, regularizations, optimizers and batchnormalization. 

## Image captioning using CNN's and LSTM's
The aim of this work was to train a neural network on an image captioning task. The training was conducted on the [Flickr8k](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/adityajn105/flickr8k) dataset. To achieve this task a combination of a pre-trained CNN (Restnet18) and an LSTM was used.
